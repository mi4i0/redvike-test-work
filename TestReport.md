### Revised Automated Testing Report

#### Test Cases Execution Summary:

1. **Test Case 1**: Form submission with valid data
    - **Status**: Passed
    - **Details**: The form was successfully submitted with valid data and the data was accurately displayed on the success page.

2. **Test Case 2**: Form submission with invalid data
    - **Status**: Passed
    - **Details**: Form submission failed when attempted with invalid data; appropriate validation messages were displayed.

3. **Test Case 3**: Slider captcha functionality
    - **Status**: Partial Pass
    - **Details**:
        - The form submission was effectively blocked when the slider captcha was not slid to the end.
        - **Issue**: Avatar image is displayed on the form page after the initial attempt to submit without sliding the captcha, but it's not saved upon completing the captcha and resubmitting. Users may need to re-upload their avatar image if they initially forget to complete the captcha.
        - **Suggested Fix**: Ensure that the avatar image remains cached or temporarily stored and is included in the submission upon completing the captcha.

4. **Test Case 4**: Avatar image upload functionality
    - **Status**: Failed
    - **Details**: Issue with GIF image type upload.
    - **Issue**: .gif image wasnâ€™t uploaded successfully.
    - **Suggested Fix**: Investigate the backend or frontend code handling the image upload and ensure support for .gif images, considering they are within the accepted image formats.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Frontend Image Type Validation**:
    - **Current Issue**: The form validates the image type after submission.
    - **Improvement**: Implement frontend validation to check the image type before form submission to enhance the user experience.

2. **Field Length Validation**:
    - **Current Issue**: Fields like first name, last name, email, password, and confirm password lack length validation.
    - **Improvement**: Add frontend validation to ensure that the input lengths for these fields are within acceptable limits to prevent errors and enhance security.

#### Conclusion:

The automated tests were successful in validating the form submission with both valid and invalid data. An issue was encountered in Test Case 3 related to the retention of the avatar image after the captcha is slid and another significant issue in Test Case 4 related to .gif image uploads. Addressing the identified issues and implementing the suggested improvements will optimize the functionality and user experience of the web application. Further testing is recommended after these fixes to ensure that the application is bug-free and operates as intended.
